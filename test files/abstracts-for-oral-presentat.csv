Patients are diagnosed late, and over 50% of them will develop metastases in liver. The prognosis is very poor, because currently there are no sufficient methods for treating. Radiotherapy plays crucial role in the treatment of UM. In cell cultures, radiotherapy has been found to induce DNA damage and cell death. In 3D models, it has shown promising efficacy in targeting its architecture, providing valuable insights into radiotherapy potential impact on tumor growth and invasion. We choose two in vitro models: 2D (clones) and 3D (spheroids) and examine their applicability in X-ray radiotherapy. Using tumors collected from patients we derived unique UM cell lines and immortal LX-2 cell line to mimic liver niche, which were used to create our models. They were treated with different doses of radiation. We investigated differences between effects after radiotherapy. Results shows that 2D model was quite sensitive to X-ray radiotherapy, while spheroids were almost completely resistant to the same doses of radiation. In 2D we can observe the effect in clones’ morphology and numbers of surviving cells depending on the used X-ray dose. In case of spheroids, two different proliferation tests gave consistent results, showing that cells survival was high, even under 10 Gy dose, and similar to control. It might be caused by several factors, mainly by hypoxia inside spheroids. During radiotherapy spheroid can loosen their structure, dead cells from cortical layer fell out, but inside hypoxic necrotic core cells were more resistant to radiation and started proliferation. In vitro studies on the effectiveness of radiotherapy for UM cannot be based only on 2D models, as they provide overly optimistic results. Studies must also be conducted on 3D models, which provide more realistic results by providing conditions more similar to those encountered during radiotherapy of solid tumors.","","","uveal melanoma, radiotherapy, clones, spheroids","Patrycja Jakubiec","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Małgorzata Szczygieł","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Weronika Giebel","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Aleksandra Bienia","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Piotr Świerzewski","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","TRUE","Martyna Elas","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Patrycja Jakubiec","Patrycja Jakubiec","patrycja.1.jakubiec@student.uj.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) show notable antimicrobial activity due to interactions with bacterial surfaces and enzymes. ZnO-NPs are non-toxic to eukaryotic cells, which is an advantage for possible applications. Magnesium is also characterised by its antibacterial properties and has high biocompatibility for human cells. In order to increase the antibacterial properties exhibited by ZnO NPs, Mg doping of ZnO matrix was proposed. The aim of our study was to evaluate the antimicrobial performance of ZnO NPs doped with different percentages of Mg (1% mol., 5% mol. and 10% mol.). Two doping precursors (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and MgCl2 ּ·6H2O) were also evaluated. Mg doped ZnO NPs were prepared using eco-friendly microwave hydrothermal technique. NPs were tested on 8 bacterial strains: Proteus sp., Salmonella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus B haemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant, Staphylococcus aureus ATTC and Staphylococcus epidermidis utilizing established protocol of modified disk diffusion method. Following 24h of bacterial growth, the inhibition zone was measured and photographed. Results showed that a more effective Mg precursor was the MgCl2·6H2O. ZnO NPs doped with 1% mol. and 5% mol. Mg exhibited stronger antibacterial activity than 10% mol. Mg. We reckon that 10% mol Mg doping may have severely altered the crystaline structure of the NPs and thus been responsible for the loss of the observed antibacterial activity.","","","antimicrobial activity, nanoparticles, Mg, ZnO","Agnieszka Wal","Warsaw University of Life Sciences – SGGW","","","","","","","","","TRUE","Agnieszka Wal, Bartłomiej Dominiak, Julita Rosowska, Zofia Klukowska, Anna Słońska, Joanna Cymerys-Bulenda, Michał M.

Researchers unveiled its positive and negative impact on cells depending on parameters and time of exposure. In search of stem cell-based therapy, it can be used as a preconditioning factor for regenerative medicine purposes. Therefore, it seems crucial to understand how electromagnetic field, in specific parameters and doses, impact stem cell biology.  Methods: Commercially available, human adipose-derived stem cells were exposed continuously to low-frequency electromagnetic fields (50 Hz; 1.5 mT) in vitro. After 24 and 48 hours, total RNA was isolated, and complementary DNA was synthesized. Next, Tuj-1, Sox9, Runx2, and Numb gene expression were analyzed with the quantitative PCR method. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA using the Tukey test. Results: Electromagnetic field (50 Hz; 1.5 mT) can statistically significantly influence the expression of Tuj 1 gene, which is related to neurogenesis after 48h of stimulation. Moreover, it impacts chondrogenic gene expression such as Sox9 after 24 and 48 hours of exposure. However, it does not affect significantly the osteogenic marker expression Runx2 as well as the Numb gene expression associated with the symmetric and asymmetric stem cell division pathway. Conclusions: Tested electromagnetic doses may “force” ASCs to redefine their stem cell fate, alter their reprogramming decision, and initiate differentiation processes. It is even more interesting, that morphologically it is unidentifiable. Further research on differentiation markers and the analysis of cellular pathways such as Notch-Numb involved in cell division should be conducted.","","","electromagnetic field, mesenchymal stem cells, differentiation, asymmetric cell division","Anna Sendera","Department of Biology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical College of Rzeszow University, Rzeszow, Poland.","Agnieszka Banaś-Ząbczyk","Department of Biology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical College of Rzeszow University, Rzeszow, Poland.","","","","","","","","","","Anna Sendera","Anna Sendera","antrzyna@ur.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

In most cases, C. albicans exists as a harmless commensal in the intestine, urogenital tract, and skin. However, under specific conditions, it can become an opportunistic pathogen, causing infections of varying severity - from superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic infections. Resistance to antifungal drugs poses a serious therapeutic challenge and can lead to treatment failures and prolonged hospitalization. The study aimed to assess the susceptibility of the nine clinical strains and the reference strain ATCC 10231 of Candida spp. to antifungal substances, two antibiotics: miconazole and 5-fluorocytosine, and three antiseptics: Octenisept, Braunol, and Prontosan. The sensitivity of strains was tested using methods recommended by EUCAST and CLSI. For all strains, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. The analysis was performed for all C. albicans strains in planktonic and on the biofilm forms.  It has been demonstrated that the analyzed strains exhibited varied sensitivity depending on the tested substance concentration and cell form. Compared to the reference strain, the clinical strains were less sensitive depending on the applied substance. Results show that 55% of the strains analyzed showed reduced sensitivity to the tested antiseptics compared to the reference strain, while for antibiotics it was 50%. The most resistant strain turned out to be strain 3440, which showed greater resistance to both antibiotics and antiseptics. Biofilm formation and sensitivity varied across strains, influenced by type, incubation time, glucose levels in the TSB medium, and the antifungal substance used. The study reveals increased resistance in Candida spp. strains could complicate treatment efforts due to varied sensitivity to antifungals and antiseptics.","","","C. albicans, resistance, biofilm, antibiotics, antiseptics","Klaudia Snopek","Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Animal Husbandry, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin, Poland","","","","","","","","","","","","Klaudia Snopek","Klaudia Snopek","klaudiasnopek1993@gmail.com","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

The aim of our research was to expand current knowledge on how epitranscriptomic modifications of viral RNA affect host cell-virus interplay. To mimic viral infection, in vitro transcribed double-stranded RNA (IVT dsRNA) carrying various chemical modifications was introduced into mammalian cells. RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis revealed that the 5’ end of dsRNA is exclusively responsible for antiviral and inflammatory immune responses mediated by RIG-I-like receptors. Further analyses revealed that the presence of the double-stranded RNA structure itself does not lead to inflammation, but leads to a global inhibition of protein synthesis via activation of the OAS/RNaseL and PKR pathways and thus cell growth. Furthermore, we showed that among three most common post-transcriptional modifications, i.e. psudouridine, 5-methylcytosine and N6-methyladenosine, the presence of m6A shields dsRNA from recognition by OAS proteins.","","","double-stranded RNA; epitranscriptomic marks; 5' end of dsRNA; innate immunity","Julia Cieslicka 1","1 Laboratory of Epitranscriptomics, Faculty of Biology, Biological and Chemical Research Centre, University of Warsaw","Karolina Drazkowska 1","1 Laboratory of Epitranscriptomics, Faculty of Biology, Biological and Chemical Research Centre, University of Warsaw","Anna Pastucha 2","2 Center for Functional Protein Assemblies, Technical University of Munich","Krzysztof Goryca 3","3 Genomics Core Facility, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw","Tomasz Kowalczyk 4","4 Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok","TRUE","Dominik Cysewski 4 , Andreas Bausch 2 , Pawel J.

In order to perform phage hunting, environmental samples (sewage water and turf soil) were filtered and concentrated. Such samples were mixed with bacteria and added to top-agar in double layer agar plates to perform screening for lytic phages against Neisseria as host. We used wild-type and mutant (in terms of antiviral defense systems) strains. Any plaques were cut out and enriched in liquid or solid culture. After concentration, lysates were titrated by spot assay. Lytic phages found in turf soil were able to infect a wild-type bacteria and one of the clinical strains. Phage particles were visualized using TEM analysis. Within a molecular approach, Neisseria prophages were screened for genes encoding proteins with potential lytic activity.

In contrast, melatonin, an  endogenous hormone with potent antioxidant properties, presents a promising avenue  for reducing such adverse effects. This study sets out to investigate the protective role  of melatonin against trifluoperazine-induced oxidative genotoxicity. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of melatonin as  an antioxidant agent in alleviating oxidative-induced genotoxicity induced by  trifluoperazine in human lymphocytes. Specifically, the study aims to elucidate the  potential therapeutic effect of melatonin in mitigating adverse effects associated with  prolonged trifluoperazine treatment. Materials and Methods: Human lymphocyte samples obtained from a healthy male  volunteer were divided into experimental groups, including negative controls, cisplatin  controls, trifluoperazine-treated groups at concentrations of 50 μM and 100 μM, and a  trifluoperazine-melatonin group at 100 μM. Genotoxicity was evaluated using the  micronucleus assay, while lipid peroxidation and glutathione oxidation levels were  measured to assess oxidative damage. Results: Trifluoperazine-exposed groups demonstrated significant increases in  micronuclei, glutathione oxidation, and lipid peroxidation compared to negative controls  (P˂0.01). Notably, treatment with melatonin led to a significant reduction in micronuclei,  glutathione oxidation, and lipid peroxidation levels in the trifluoperazine-exposed groups  (P˂0.05).

Therefore, microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) remain the most important class of conventional chemotherapeutics. However, narrow therapeutic index and multidrug resistance encourage the search for new drugs or new strategies to improve anticancer therapy outcomes and decrease side effects. Taxanes (paclitaxel, PTX), docetaxel, and carbasitaxel), which belong to MTAs, have revolutionized the therapy of solid tumors. However, their hydrophobic nature as well as peripheral neuropathies are among the major limitations and adverse effects of taxane therapy. Combining taxanes with tubulin polymerization inhibitors is one of the strategies that increase the effectiveness of treatment. However, this approach involves high-dose administration of chemotherapeutic agents and causes many side effects.

Nevertheless, the knowledge of their effects on human epithelial tissues is still insufficient. It has been already proven that micro- and nanoplastics act as vectors enabling the spread of organic pollutants, they interact with heavy metals and show cell-toxicity. The information whether and how nanoplastics can affect transepithelial water and ion transport is still limited.   This research aimed to investigate the effects of polysterene nanoplastics (diameter of 100 nm) on human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2. Following the exposure to polystyrene nanoplastic (PS-NP.), its cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay. The effect of PS-NP on mucus secretion was assessed by Alcian blue staining. Additionally, the changes of ion transport across Caco-2 cell monolayers in the presence of PS-NP was assessed by short-circuit current measurements in Ussing chamber.   The results show that nanoplastics affect the ion transport across the cell monolayers and lead to increased mucus secretion. The presence of nanoplastics decreased CFTR channel activity, however, increased the activity of other chloride channels. Application of ion transporting proteins modulators allowed determining the TMEM16a involvement in increased chloride currents. Increased activity of TMEM16a may also be responsible for enhanced mucus secretion which is a possible defensive mechanism of Caco-2 cells against nanoplastics.

Therefore, more ecological solutions are now being intensively sought. Recently a new product has appeared on the market – Bee’s Wraps – a biodegradable alternative to traditional food packaging made of cotton and beeswax. The high price makes them not available to everyone. Recent research showed that bacterial cellulose (BC) can be used as an ideal food packaging material. This biopolymer is produced by non-pathogenic environmental bacteria. It was confirmed that BC is safe, non-toxic, fully biodegradable and can be used in the food industry.   The aim of this study was to prepare ecological food packaging material based on BC impregnated with various types of waxes: beeswax and plant waxes.   The production process involved BC biosynthesis by Komagataeibacter xylinus ATCC 53524, followed by purification, homogenization, and drying or lyophilization. Optimalization of the production process included different process parameters: pulp volume, pulp density, and freezing temperature. The foils were covered with various types of waxes using the ironing machine. Samples were subjected to further analysis such as macro- and microstructure analysis, water properties (swelling ratio, water permeability), contact angle and antimicrobial properties.    The foil production method used in this study allowed to obtain an innovative food packaging based on BC covered with wax. A smooth and even structure of foils was achieved by drying the cellulose pulp mixed with water in a ratio of 1:2. Covering the foils with wax gave it specific plastic properties. The results showed that wax-impregnated BC films are hydrophobic. It was confirmed that obtained samples have antimicrobial and against both Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria. This solution can provide cheap, ecological and safe food packaging for home use.","","","beeswax; antimicrobal properties; biopolymer;","Elżbieta Lichwiarska","Student Scientific Club ""BioReaktor"", Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Animal Husbandry, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin, Piastów 45, 70-311 Szczecin, Poland","Anna Żywicka","Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Animal Husbandry, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin, Piastów 45, 70-311 Szczecin, Poland","","","","","","","","","","Elżbieta Lichwiarska","Elżbieta Lichwiarska","le47685@zut.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

Protection of water against pollution becomes the main problem to be solved because sewage is one of the elements that largely pollute aquatic ecosystems. The analysis of wastewater management in Poland was made on the basis of statistical data provided by the Central Statistical Office. However, the analysis of the quality of sewage and the Pichna river water, which is a sewage receiver, was carried out in the laboratory of the European Regional Center for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.  As a result of the ranking analysis of voivodeships in terms of the emission of pollutants discharged from industrial and municipal sewage treatment plants, it was found that the highest pollutant load in treated sewage in 2019 was discharged by the voivodeships with the highest population density. The development of wastewater management through the country is gradually improving over the years.  Wastewater treatment plants in large cities and industrial plants are often equipped with modern treatment systems based on new technologies that ensure effective wastewater treatment and hygienization. The situation is often much worse in small and medium-sized wastewater treatment plants. The sewage treatment technology in Szadek did not enable adequate removal of biogenic compounds and suspended solids from the sewage during the research period. The Sequential Wastewater Biofiltration System is extremely necessary to purify treated sewage and prevent the outflow of pollutants into the Pichna River.

Unfortunately, most antibiotics in clinical use today were developed in the 1980s – the golden age of antibiotic therapy. The imbalance between the demand for new drugs and their supply has prompted a search for novel strategies to combat resistant microbes.  	Modern approaches in drug discovery employ short antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the immune systems of various organisms. Most AMPs act by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane through the interaction of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of amphipathic peptide helices. Nevertheless, most AMPs require a lipid environment to acquire this structure.  	We hypothesized that stabilizing the AMP structure could enhance its antibacterial activity due to adopting a membrane-active helix already in an aqueous solution. To test this hypothesis, we modified the AMPs using hydrocarbon stapling [1,2]. Our results indicate that stapled peptides adopt a stable helical structure, exhibit enhanced bactericidal activity, remain stable in proteolytic enzyme solutions, and demonstrate no toxicity to eukaryotic cells, including red blood cells [1,2]. Moreover, we are developing a computational approach to design new modified AMPs containing non-natural amino acids. Our studies will aid the future design of AMPs with improved bactericidal activity and biostability.

Bingo is also rich in dietary fiber and bioactive substances like ß-glucan, which protects against diseases like coronary artery disease and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. As recommended by COBORU, Bingo is the ideal variety for cultivation in Poland. Various instrumental methods have been used to analyze the qualitative characteristics of Bingo oat grains, including calorimetry, thanks to which it was established that oat grains are an excellent source of energy. Extraction using the Soxhlet method allowed for the determination of the oil content, and thanks to gas chromatography the composition of fatty acids in the extracted oils was determined. Titration allowed us to determine the content of free fatty acids and peroxides in oil, while differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC) allowed us to determine the oxidative stability of oil.

Therefore, such phages can be used as a sensing element in a biosensor[2]. Consequently, our aim is to find an effective support for the immobilization of the phage that could be implemented in electrochemical systems. In our studies, we used hydrogenated laterally spaced TiO2 nanotubes which were fabricated via anodization[3] and calcination in hydrogen atmosphere. Due to the hydrogenation, titania nanotubes exhibit high electric conductivity that combined with substantial surface area make them excellent electrode material. We measured the response of the titania nanotube electrodes in various concentrations of adsorbed M13 phages using square wave and cyclic voltammetry in the presence of 1,1-ferrocenedimethanol as a redox probe. Moreover time-dependent measurements were performed to evaluate the stability of the electrode modified with phage. The obtained results demonstrated that the phages were successfully adsorbed on the electrode surface. That suggests the potential use of hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes as a conductive and adhesive layer for M13 phages in biosensors.

Subsequently, phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Our study revealed the presence of host-dependent genetic variation in leaf blister mites. This study shows that mites inhabiting apple, pear, rowan, and quince were Eriophyes mali, E. pyri, E. sorbi, and E. orientalis respectively. However, huge genetic variability observed within E. mali, E. pyri, and E. sorbi suggests further cryptic speciation.

One of its objectives is the prevention of zoonotic diseases, which account for up to 60% of all infectious diseases in humans. Among the bacteria naturally occurring in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and wild animals, capable of causing opportunistic infections, are Enterococcus spp. The most common species are E. faecalis and E. faecium. These can pose significant therapeutic challenges as they demonstrate resistance to several groups of antibiotics, and they feature genes that determine virulence factor such as adhesins, and gelatinase. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of genes encoding selected virulence factors in strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolated from fecal samples of wild animals. The material for the study consisted of 98 fecal samples collected from 9 species of wild animals in forest areas. Bacteria were isolated from feces by culturing on selective media, and species identification was performed using the MALDI ̶ TOF MS method. The presence of six virulence genes (pil, gelE, efaAsf, ebpA, ebpB and ebpC,) was determined using PCR. Products were separated by electrophoresis of samples in 1.5% agarose gel. The study identified 38 strains E. faecalis and 10 E. faecium. All six tested genes were detected, with gelE being the most frequently detected gene in E. faecalis strains (94.74%), and pil being the least frequently detected (21.05%). In the case of E. faecium, only one gene (ebpC) was detected in one sample. At least one virulence gene was detected in 97.37% of all E. faecalis strains. All six genes were detected in two strains isolated from a fox and a raccoon dog. The set of ebpA, ebpB, and ebpC genes was detected in 28.95% of E. faecalis strains. In current literature, there are few works addressing this issue among the wild fauna in Poland. This study contributes to the current state of knowledge and may serve as a basis for further research and analysis.","","","wild animals; faeces; virulence genes; E. faecalis; E. faecium","Wiktor Borkowski","Ludwig Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Microbiology (M.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), characterized by elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) and related metabolites is an  independent risk factor for AD but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Hcy is a sulfur containing amino acid. It is created from methionine supplied with food and then converted back into methionine in the remethylation process, cysteine in the transsulfuration process or into homocysteine thiolactone (HTL). HHcy may induce ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) by  HTL which has ability to modify protein lysine residues and generate immunogenic N-homocysteinylated proteins. Alternatively, ER stress may be induced by Hcy, whose free thiol may disrupt disulfide bonds in proteins. Although both mechanisms are plausible, HTL, but not Hcy, causes protein aggregation and is more effective, compared with Hcy, as an inducer of ER stress and  UPR. We studied the expression of ER stress-inducible ATF3, and UPR-responsive GRP78/BiP and GADD153/CHOP genes at the protein level in Hcy, HTL and N-homocysteinylated proteins treated mouse neuroblastoma N2a-APPSwe cells.

The field of the protein nanocages can be roughly divided into: natural protein nanocages like viral capsids and artificial protein nanocages, like TRAP. The trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) is the 74 amino acid-long protein from the species Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Eleven units of the TRAP proteins self-assemble into the ring-like structure and it takes part in the regulation of the l-tryptophan metabolism. The engineered TRAP protein contains the mutation K35C which is located on the ring’s rim position. The addition of gold promotes the self-assembly of the TRAP rings into a cage-like structure with a molecular size of around 2 Megadaltons.  In my research, I have designed two other mutants with metal-binding sites. All proteins were overexpressed in E.coli and purified via the standard laboratory techniques.  Studied mutants were shown to make cage-like structures upon mixing with zinc and cobalt. All of the studied protein nanocages possess very similar architecture and biochemical properties. Both cobalt and zinc TRAP protein nanocages are readily disassembled in the presence of the chelating agents (EDTA) and in the acidic and alkaline pH. However, once the pH is neutral back and the slight excess of the divalent cations are added in the presence of EDTA, all studied non-gold mediated TRAP protein nanocages are reassembled. This feature of the TRAP nanocage makes it a promising tool for the smart delivery of drugs to the target site. In conclusion, the TRAP protein nanocage is a unique artificial protein nanocage. The possibility to easily assemble/reassemble it in relatively mild conditions could make the non-gold mediated TRAP protein nanocage an excellent choice for future drug delivery studies.  1 Malay, A, D. et al.

Therefore, microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) remain the most important class of conventional chemotherapeutics. However, narrow therapeutic index and multidrug resistance encourage the search for new drugs or new strategies to improve anticancer therapy outcomes and decrease side effects. Taxanes (paclitaxel, PTX), docetaxel, and carbasitaxel), which belong to MTAs, have revolutionized the therapy of solid tumors.

Combining taxanes with tubulin polymerization inhibitors is one of the strategies that increase the effectiveness of treatment. However, this approach involves high-dose administration of chemotherapeutic agents and causes many side effects.

In previous studies of cell proliferation and quiescence, yeast models have proven to be excellent model organisms. They are susceptible to genetic modifications, can easily attain the state of quiescence through nutritional limitations and many of their cellular mechanisms are in correspondence with those in mammalian cells. Consequently, better characterization of these mechanisms could contribute to our understanding of cell functions and to new discoveries concerning human health, including cancer and degenerative diseases research. This particular study focuses on the effects of mRNA modifications and stability on the quiescence state of Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast cells achieved with the deficit of nitrogen source. The main objective of the experiment is the examination of the survivability and recovery from quiescence in S. pombe cells, as well as the effects of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation on cellular quiescence by exploring yeast mutants associated with processes such as uridylation (Δcid1), 5' mRNA degradation (Δlsm1), 3' RNA degradation (Δski2) or poly(A) tail binding (Δpabp). So far, the obtained results have shown a discrepancy between quiescence survival rates and recovery time between different deletion strains, with the lowest values for Δlsm1 strain and double deletion mutant Δcid1Δlsm1. Morphological differences were also observed. Previous studies have succeeded in identifying and characterizing a number of genes responsible for the entry and maintenance of quiescence which had links to cellular functions in the cytoplasm, membrane and nucleus.

The state before the first light exposition is known as etiolation. It is characterised by elongation of cotyledons, leaf underdevelopment, and pale yellow colour (absence of chloroplasts). The process of deetiolation is initiated by exposure to light, which triggers a series of biochemical reactions and cellular rearrangements. Despite extensive research on photosynthesis, the early stages of deetiolation remain somewhat elusive. To shed light on the initial steps of deetiolation, we conducted extensive research on Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) mutants with disrupted pathways related to photosynthesis. Our investigation involved gene expression analysis utilizing quantitative PCR, low-temperature fluorescence to examine photosystem formation, high-performance liquid chromatography for porphyrin and xanthophyll biosynthesis, and in vivo fluorescence imaging to determine maximum photosystem quantum yield during the first 24 hours of deetiolation. We focused particularly on the first four hours of the process. Our approach yielded new insights into the early stages of deetiolation, laying the groundwork for a better understanding of the formation of photosynthetic apparatus. Research was partially founded by the National Science Centre, within the Sonata Bis project no UMO-2013/10/E/NZ3/00748.","","","photosynthesis; etiolation; deetiolation; arabidopsis thaliana; plant development","Kamil F.

ALS is characterized by the death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, while FTD is defined by the loss of neurons in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe of the brain. G4C2 hexanucleotide repeats are located in the non-coding region of the C9orf72 gene. They can over-multiply leading to the development of ALS/FTD. Transcripts of the C9orf72 gene also contain multiplied hexanucleotide repeats and can adopt complex secondary and tertiary structures, including hairpin structures or tetraplex structures. The presented investigations are focused on structural analysis of RNA containing G4C2 repeats, using x-ray diffraction methods. The RNA oligomers were chemically synthesized and crystallized. The x-ray diffraction data were collected at synchroton in Hamburg. The processed data was further used for structure solving. During my presentation, I will discuss the details of this process and show 3D models of the G4C2 RNA repeats.","","","RNA; Crystallography; ALS; FTD;","Miłosz Papierski","Uniwersytet im.

To prevent cell damage associated with the formation of ice crystals, cryoprotectants are added, which are intended to lower the freezing point of water.  An ideal cryoprotectant should demonstrate low toxicity, lack of reactivity, high solubility, and permeability. An alternative to currently used substances may be bacterial cellulose (BC). It is a biopolymer produced by various strains of microorganisms, characterized by biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and high strength. The aim of the study was to apply BC as a protective substance for bacteria cells subjected to cryopreservation. Biomass of 3 microorganisms was used for the research: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. BC was obtained by culturing Komagataeibacter xylinus bacteria, then subjected to purification and grinding to obtain powder. In addition to BC, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and glycerol were used as cryoprotectants in concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 20% in the experiments. The number of viable cells after cryopreservation and incubation lasting 7, 14, 21, and 28 days at a temperature of -80ºC was evaluated. The results showed that the number of viable cells after cryopreservation with the addition of BC was comparable to the trials with the addition of DMSO and glycerol. BC used at concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 20% achieved the best results at the level of 100% viable cells after 7 days of storage. With longer incubation, the viability of E. coli cells stored with the addition of BC was on average 30% higher compared to DMSO or glycerol, while the viability of C. albicans cells was comparable (average of 100%) for all substances. It was shown that BC acts more effectively as a cryoprotective agent for S. aureus cells than glycerol, as a result 20% higher for BC was obtained. The study demonstrated that BC could potentially be used as a cryoprotectant.","","","cryoprotectant;microorganism;bacterial cellulose","Nikola Kabała","Student Scientific Club ""BioReaktor""*, West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin","","","","","","","","","","","","Nikola Kabała","Nikola Kabała","nikolakabala11@gmail.com","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

Hcy is a sulfur containing amino acid. It is created from methionine supplied with food and then converted back into methionine in the remethylation process, cysteine in the transsulfuration process or into homocysteine thiolactone (HTL). HHcy may induce ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) by  HTL which has ability to modify protein lysine residues and generate immunogenic N-homocysteinylated proteins. Alternatively, ER stress may be induced by Hcy, whose free thiol may disrupt disulfide bonds in proteins. Although both mechanisms are plausible, HTL, but not Hcy, causes protein aggregation and is more effective, compared with Hcy, as an inducer of ER stress and  UPR.

Researchers unveiled its positive and negative impact on cells depending on parameters and time of exposure. In search of stem cell-based therapy, it can be used as a preconditioning factor for regenerative medicine purposes. Therefore, it seems crucial to understand how electromagnetic field, in specific parameters and doses, impact stem cell biology.  Methods: Commercially available, human adipose-derived stem cells were exposed continuously to low-frequency electromagnetic fields (50 Hz; 1.5 mT) in vitro. After 24 and 48 hours, total RNA was isolated, and complementary DNA was synthesized. Next, Tuj-1, Sox9, Runx2, and Numb gene expression were analyzed with the quantitative PCR method. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA using the Tukey test. Results: Electromagnetic field (50 Hz; 1.5 mT) can statistically significantly influence the expression of Tuj 1 gene, which is related to neurogenesis after 48h of stimulation. Moreover, it impacts chondrogenic gene expression such as Sox9 after 24 and 48 hours of exposure. However, it does not affect significantly the osteogenic marker expression Runx2 as well as the Numb gene expression associated with the symmetric and asymmetric stem cell division pathway. Conclusions: Tested electromagnetic doses may “force” ASCs to redefine their stem cell fate, alter their reprogramming decision, and initiate differentiation processes. It is even more interesting, that morphologically it is unidentifiable. Further research on differentiation markers and the analysis of cellular pathways such as Notch-Numb involved in cell division should be conducted.","","","electromagnetic field, mesenchymal stem cells, differentiation, asymmetric cell division","Anna Sendera","Department of Biology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical College of Rzeszow University, Rzeszow, Poland.","Agnieszka Banaś-Ząbczyk","Department of Biology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical College of Rzeszow University, Rzeszow, Poland.","","","","","","","","","","Anna Sendera","Anna Sendera","antrzyna@ur.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

The lethal nature of the disease in 90% of cases is determined by metastases. The ability to undergo metastasis results from a number of metabolic, genetic and epigenetic changes in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. The complexity of the metastasis process and its multi-stage nature have been better understood thanks to mouse cancer models. We have used weakly metastasizing breast cancer line E0771, and its two modified sublines with increased migratory abilities (E0771 TGF-β and 24x2). The aim of the study was to investigate the kinetics of the formation and development of spontaneous metastases in the three sublines of orthotopically grown tumors in C57BL/6 mice. The ability of the three sublines to migrate and be invasive was checked using plates with Transwell inserts. Then, the cells were inoculated orthotopically into the breast fat-pads of female C56BL/6 mice to determine the kinetics of formation and the number of micrometastases in vivo. For this purpose, mice were euthanized and tumors, lungs and livers were isolated. Tissues were analyzed macroscopically, histologically and by seeding isolated cells for clonal analysis. Our results confirmed the greater migratory capacity of TGF-β and 24x2 subline cells. We noticed more metastases accumulating in the lung than in the liver. In the lung, their size  increased linearly with time, while in the liver the increase was less steep. First metastases appear in the lung already a week after the inoculation of cancer cells into the breast fat-pad. The expression of cell migration markers: SNAIL-1, vimentin and CD43 correlated with the invasiveness in vivo. The results provide the basis for a better understanding of the course of the metastatic cascade.. We have shown that it is influenced by inflammatory factors like TGF-β and mechanic selection of cells able to pass through pores, and that increased metastatic ability is connected to more mesenchymal phenotype.","","","Breast Cancer; Metastases; Migration; Invasiveness","Bartosz Płóciennik","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Agnieszka Drzał","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Maciej Pudełek","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Cell Biology","Julia Kozik","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Martyna Elas","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","TRUE","Jan Pamuła","Jagiellonian University, Facility of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology","Bartosz Płóciennik","Bartosz Płóciennik","bartosz.plociennik@student.uj.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

Briefly, our system consisted of a droplet-generation chip with multiple parallel channels for fabricating droplets with encapsulated cells. These droplets were carried by the continuous phase (oil-surfactant) to a crosslinking chip placed before an LED UV lamp. Post-washing these crosslinked droplets were placed for long-term culture. This system was used for various applications like encapsulation of pancreatic β-cells for Type-I diabetes therapy and co-encapsulation of leukemia with bone marrow stroma cells for drug-resistance analysis. For a complex droplet-in-droplet system, the droplets (“cores”) were collected post-washing and mixed with another uncrosslinked hydrogel solution containing cells and were passed through a T-junction channel chip to form the “shell”.
