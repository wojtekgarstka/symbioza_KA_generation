Scientists constantly refine these techniques through genetic modifications to enhance effectiveness and safety. An innovative approach to viral tracing integrates the use of pseudotyped rabies virus (RV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV). The AAV helper vector facilitates the delivery of TVA and RabG proteins to specific cell types through the utilization of specific promoters crucial for subsequent steps and essential for tracing specific inputs. Once the TVA receptor is produced, it forms a specialized 'lock' for the EnvA pseudotyped version of the RV. The EnvA glycoprotein acts as the ""key"" for the RV to enter specific cells. Following infection, the EnvA Rabies virus proliferates and becomes complemented with RabG protein produced by AAV-infected cells. This complementation restores the RV's ability to infect monosynaptically and retrogradely input to starter cells. The primary objective of this study is to assess the transduction efficacy in primary cell neurons and evaluate the selectivity of specific promoters using AAV vectors. Furthermore, we aim to optimize the AAV-RV tracing technique in primary cell neurons. We firmly believe that this innovative approach, using a modified RV-AAV tracing technique, will enable precise cell-type-specific network tracing within the intricate of the retina and further development of novel therapies for vision restoration.

The World Health Organization reports that over 2.2 billion individuals struggle with visual impairment or blindness. It is necessary to search for new, innovative, and effective treatment methods for retinal degenerative diseases. Gene and/or viral therapy stands out as a promising tool among these approaches. An unconventional solution may be Rabies virus (RV), a (-)RNA rhabdovirus that has the ability to infect neurons via retrograde transport (from postsynaptic to presynaptic cells) and can carry very large cargos. Delivery of therapeutic genes to the target cells is a key step in gene therapy, and RV infections are not cell-type unique, therefore gene delivery cannot be specifically controlled.  Specific Rabies virus injections are possible through pseudotyping of G-deleted RV (RV∆G) with a chimeric protein responsible for interacting with the cell-type-specific receptor. This project aims to use strategy of changing the tropism of the Rabies virus to infect ON-bipolar cells specifically. We propose that using RV pseudotyped with the extracellular part of LRIT3 (RV-exLRIT3) will specifically infect bipolar cells. As a first step we prepared lentivirus expressing exLRIT3-oG protein (glycoprotein of Rabies virus) used for transduction of BHK-21 and stable cell line generation. The next step involves producing pseudotyped Rabies virus (RV-exLRIT3) and verifying specificity through immunohistochemistry assays. The project seeks to advance our understanding of pseudotyping techniques and their potential applications in gene therapies, ultimately paving the way for innovative treatments for retinal neurodegenerative disorders.","","","pseudotyping; Rabies virus; lentivirus; gene therapy","Lucyna Piórkowska","International Centre for Translational Eye Research, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences","Jagoda Płaczkiewicz","International Centre for Translational Eye Research, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences","Andrzej T Foik","International Centre for Translational Eye Research, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences","","","","","","","","Lucyna Piórkowska","Lucyna Piórkowska","lpiorkowska@ichf.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

Hypertension has emerged as a potential modulator of tumorigenesis and treatment outcomes across various cancers, including brain tumors. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative proteomic analysis of glioma patients (n=90) with and without hypertension to unravel the molecular signatures associated with hypertension in the context of brain tumorigenesis. Through mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis and using tandem mass tags (TMT) for isobaric labelling, we identified distinct molecular signatures in brain tumor patients with hypertension. Notably, two proteins, mitochondrial ATP synthase and Sorting nexin-17, were uniquely observed in patients with hypertension, indicating their potential roles as mediators of tumorigenesis in hypertensive individuals. Additionally, we observed a downregulation of four proteins in brain tumor samples from patients with hypertension compared to those without hypertension: Myeloperoxidase, NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit, Plexins, and EH domain-containing protein 3, suggesting their potential involvement in hypertension-associated tumor development. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay between hypertension and brain tumorigenesis at the molecular level, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for further investigation.

To prevent cell damage associated with the formation of ice crystals, cryoprotectants are added, which are intended to lower the freezing point of water.  An ideal cryoprotectant should demonstrate low toxicity, lack of reactivity, high solubility, and permeability. An alternative to currently used substances may be bacterial cellulose (BC). It is a biopolymer produced by various strains of microorganisms, characterized by biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and high strength. The aim of the study was to apply BC as a protective substance for bacteria cells subjected to cryopreservation. Biomass of 3 microorganisms was used for the research: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. BC was obtained by culturing Komagataeibacter xylinus bacteria, then subjected to purification and grinding to obtain powder. In addition to BC, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and glycerol were used as cryoprotectants in concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 20% in the experiments. The number of viable cells after cryopreservation and incubation lasting 7, 14, 21, and 28 days at a temperature of -80ºC was evaluated. The results showed that the number of viable cells after cryopreservation with the addition of BC was comparable to the trials with the addition of DMSO and glycerol. BC used at concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 20% achieved the best results at the level of 100% viable cells after 7 days of storage. With longer incubation, the viability of E. coli cells stored with the addition of BC was on average 30% higher compared to DMSO or glycerol, while the viability of C. albicans cells was comparable (average of 100%) for all substances. It was shown that BC acts more effectively as a cryoprotective agent for S. aureus cells than glycerol, as a result 20% higher for BC was obtained.

Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon allotrope, exhibits remarkable electrical conductivity and gained interest as a suitable for neural interfacing and tissue engineering. Its derivative, graphene oxide, is characterized by increased biocompatibility, while nanodiamonds possess biologically inert surfaces and high surface area, making them ideal candidates for drug delivery and biomedical imaging applications. Conducting the experiments on primary cultures isolated from neural tissue of 10-day chicken embryos, we assessed the biocompatibility of the presented carbon allotropes, also combined with ascorbic acid. Cell viability and morphology was assessed using MTT assay, May-Grunwald Giemsa staining, as well as an imaging by confocal microscopy was performed. Application of ascorbic acid augmented the potential benefits of the nanomaterials toward neural cells, especially for graphene oxide. Our findings suggest that graphene oxide and its combination with ascorbic acid, positively influence cell survival and has favourable impact on the structure and function of nerve cells. These results underscore the potential therapeutic applications of carbon nanomaterials combined with other bioactive compounds in neuroprotection and regeneration, highlighting the importance of further mechanistic investigations to elucidate their precise mechanisms of action and optimize their efficacy in treating neurodegenerative diseases.","","","Graphene, Graphene oxide, Nanodiamond, Ascorbic acid, Chicken embryo","Michał Motrenko","Interdepartmental Scientific Society of Nanobiotechnology, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences","Sylwia Jankowska","Interdepartmental Scientific Society of Nanobiotechnology, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences","Martyna Klimek","Interdepartmental Scientific Society of Nanobiotechnology, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences","Maria Kuczyńska","Interdepartmental Scientific Society of Nanobiotechnology, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences","Julia Piskorz","Interdepartmental Scientific Society of Nanobiotechnology, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences","TRUE","Katarzyna Wojtka, Barbara Strojny-Cieślak, Michał Pruchniewski","Interdepartmental Scientific Society of Nanobiotechnology, Faculty of Biology and

One of the main sources of drug-resistant strains is animal production, including poultry production as the most consumed meat worldwide. This study aimed to compare resistance levels of E. coli in conventional and antibiotic-free poultry flocks.  E. coli resistant to antibiotics belonging to 6 different classes in fecal samples collected from conventional and antibiotic-free poultry farms were characterized phenotypically using the disc diffusion test and genotypically using multiplex-PCR. The level of resistant E. coli strains isolated from samples taken from conventional and antibiotic-free farms was similar and was estimated to be 92,59% and 94,45%, respectively. Whereas, 143 resistance genes were detected in samples from conventional farms, while strains from antibiotic-free farms had 109 resistance genes. Compared to strains from antibiotic-free farms, strains from conventional farms have more resistance genes to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, sulfonamides and tetracyclines. The most common resistance genes in strains from both types of farms were genes associated with sulphonamides-resistance (sul1, sul2), as well as a gene associated with resistance to tetracycline (tetA). 9,26% from conventional farms and 9,30% from antibiotic-free farms showed resistance to “last chance” antibiotic colistin. Based on the obtained research results, it can be concluded that isolated strains are drug-resistant. More resistance genes were detected in strains from conventional farms, confirming the theory that prolonged use of a single antibiotic contributes to the selection of bacteria resistant not only to that antibiotic, but also to several others. The development of antibiotic-free farms contributes to a lower number of resistance genes in E. coli strains.

A way to detect heavy metal ions could be the use of electrochemical methods combined with biosensors. The receptor layer of these sensors can consist of aptamers - DNA/RNA sequences selective for a defined analyte, which are identified through SELEX process. Interestingly, most scientific reports omit such parameters as storage stability and regeneration of receptor layers, which are crucial concerning potential commercialization of the sensor. Therefore, this work focuses on investigating the regeneration conditions of aptamer-based receptor layers for the detection of Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions. The storage conditions were also examined. To this aim, the biosensor response was compared after a given storage time with the response immediately after biosensor preparation. For regeneration studies, heavy metal ion complexing reagents such as EDTA and NTA were used. Electrochemical regeneration was also attempted using cyclic voltammetry technique.

One of the efficient biocontrol mechanisms identified in these microorganisms is the secretion of lytic enzymes limiting the growth of pathogenic fungi.  The studies aimed to evaluate the lytic activity of endophytic strain P. fluorescens BRZ63 in the presence of common fungal phytopathogens: F. avenaceum, R. solani, C. dematium or S. sclerotiorum and designing and construction of insertional cassettes essential for the evaluation of chitinolytic enzymes role in the biological activity of the strain.  The ability of strain to produce chitinases was assessed using a medium containing colloidal chitin. Chitinase activity in control and fungus-supplemented cultures was determined by spectrophotometry. To construct the gene cassettes composed of an antibiotic resistance gene flanked by short regions homologous to the target gene, primers of 80 nucleotides in length with restriction sites for EcoRI were designed using the Geneious Prime software. The designed cassettes were PCR synthesized on pACYC184 plasmid as the template.  The tested strain produced chitinases, and the activity of this enzyme complex depended on the type of fungal pathogen. Sequencing and analysis of the genome of strain BRZ63 revealed the presence of many genes potentially involved in its biological activity, including the bglX (β-glucosidase) and nagA (N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase) involved in degradation and chitin metabolism. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the selected genes, PCR reactions yielded linear cassettes containing regions homologous to the target, which will be used to inactivate the genes in vivo through the homology recombination, thus providing insight into their role in the biocontrol process in strain P. fluorescens BRZ63.","","","biocontrol, endophytes, lytic enzymes, gene cassetts, homology recombination","Dawid Męcik","Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland","Daria Chlebek","Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland","Katarzyna Hupert-Kocurek","Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland","","","","","","","","Dawid Męcik","Katarzyna Hupert-Kocurek, Dawid Męcik","katarzyna.hupert-kocurek@us.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

During the replication of RNA viruses, highly immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules are produced. The aim of our research was to expand current knowledge on how epitranscriptomic modifications of viral RNA affect host cell-virus interplay. To mimic viral infection, in vitro transcribed double-stranded RNA (IVT dsRNA) carrying various chemical modifications was introduced into mammalian cells. RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis revealed that the 5’ end of dsRNA is exclusively responsible for antiviral and inflammatory immune responses mediated by RIG-I-like receptors. Further analyses revealed that the presence of the double-stranded RNA structure itself does not lead to inflammation, but leads to a global inhibition of protein synthesis via activation of the OAS/RNaseL and PKR pathways and thus cell growth. Furthermore, we showed that among three most common post-transcriptional modifications, i.e. psudouridine, 5-methylcytosine and N6-methyladenosine, the presence of m6A shields dsRNA from recognition by OAS proteins.","","","double-stranded RNA ; epitranscriptomic marks ; 5' end of dsRNA ; innate immunity","Julia Cieslicka1","1 Laboratory of Epitranscriptomics, Faculty of Biology, Biological and Chemical Research Centre, University of Warsaw","Karolina Drazkowska1","1 Laboratory of Epitranscriptomics, Faculty of Biology, Biological and Chemical Research Centre, University of Warsaw","Anna Pastucha2","2 Center for Functional Protein Assemblies, Technical University of Munich","Krzysztof Goryca3","3 Genomics Core Facility, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw","Tomasz Kowalczyk4","4 Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok","TRUE","Dominik Cysewski4, Andreas Bausch2, Pawel J.

The last step is of particular importance as it not only ensures the release of mRNA from the transcription complex and the addition of a polyA tail to its 3'-end but also contributes to transcription termination. 3'-end processing is performed by the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) complex containing a number of proteins that assemble on a nascent transcript after RNA polymerase II has transcribed the polyadenylation signal (PAS). Many eukaryotic genes enable the formation of transcripts with several PAS that are recognized under specific conditions resulting in the alternative polyadenylation. This process is important for the regulation of 3'UTR length in mRNAs, but may also alter the coding sequence. 3'UTRs are crucial for gene expression regulation as they are involved in determining mRNAs’ stability, localization, and translation efficiency. Our laboratory is interested in factors influencing the PAS choice. To understand this, we aim to reconstitute the CPA complex in vitro. Recent works have identified a list of 14 proteins that are necessary and sufficient to perform the in vitro cleavage. We are currently working on the production of those factors in the insect cells-baculovirus expression system which allows for obtaining the multiprotein complexes. We are particularly concentrated on the mPSF (mammalian polyadenylation specificity factor) subcomplex of the CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) complex which contains four proteins, CPSF30, WDR33, CPSF160, and FIP1, involved in the recognition of PAS hexamer that allows other factors to proceed with 3'-end processing.

However, satellite cells are not the only cells involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. Many different cell populations in skeletal muscle are directly or indirectly involved in this process. Such cell populations include pericytes, which are responsible for stabilizing blood vessels. However, the exact characteristics of the pericyte populations in skeletal muscles and their role in regeneration are not well understood. In my study, I focused on a population of MCAM+ pericytes to evaluate their contribution to the muscle regeneration process. I isolated chemically injured mouse hind limb skeletal muscles on the 3rd, 7th, 14th, or 21st day of regeneration. I analyzed the levels of mRNA encoding markers of pericytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or satellite cells using real-time PCR. I obtained muscle frozen sections that were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for colocalization of MCAM protein with laminin. I observed dynamic changes in the level of mRNA encoding pericyte markers such as MCAM, ALP, and PDGFRβ. On the 3rd day of muscle regeneration, the expression of genes encoding these markers decreased significantly, while on the 7th day of regeneration, they reached a peak in expression. This observation was consistent with the results obtained by immunohistochemistry, where the number of cells synthesizing MCAM protein was the highest on the 7th day of regeneration. On days 14th and 21st, mRNA levels of pericyte markers were comparable to the uninjured samples. I confirmed that MCAM+ cells are most likely involved in the regeneration of muscle fibers.

Among its components, T lymphocytes hold significance for orchestrating humoral and cellular immune responses through the secretion of cytokines. Importantly, T cells also participate in cancer cell eradication. Tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by hypoxia and oxidative stress. These conditions collectively impair T cell functionality, compromising critical immune responses. This prompts inquiry into the mechanisms by which T cells adapt to such adverse conditions. A promising avenue of investigation lies in the activation of TRPM2 ion channels, primarily induced by elevated ADPR levels consequent to oxidative stress. Other activators of TRPM2 include: TNF-α, β-amyloid peptide, intracellular Ca2+, calmodulin. TRPM2 is inhibited by decreased pH, which provide a mechanism limiting Ca2+ influx during ischemia or inflammation. Research suggests that the TRPM2 channel may be involved in regulating immune processes by influencing the proliferation, differentiation, and function of T cells, especially in response to oxidative stress. The aim of our research is to assess the activation of the TRPM2 channel in  mononuclear peripheral blood cells (PBMC) using hydrogen peroxide, as well as model compounds for chemical hypoxia such as lactic acid and cobalt chloride. For this purpose, measurements of Ca2+ influx into PBMCs were conducted following exposure to these compounds alongside viability assessments. A significant increase in fluorescence was observed after incubating PBMCs with H2O2. However, in the case of lactic acid and cobalt chloride,  a gradual decrease in fluorescence was observed.

All concentrations of the used NPs showed strong fungicidal properties against the isolated fungi. The most sensitive strain was C. glabrata and C. albicans while the strongest resistance was shown by C.parapsylosis. Against all isolates CuNPs showed the strongest biocidal properties reducing the survival of isolates to 1-8%.

An example of their use is the extraction of oil from fruit seeds, which should meet certain requirements to be approved for human consumption [1]. Oils, due to their chemical structure, are easily oxidized, which is the most important cause of oil degradation during storage.  The aim of the study was to determine the changes in the pomegranate seed oil after storage. The fat fraction was analyzed for fatty acid composition by gas chromatography (GC) and oxidative stability using pressure differential scanning colorimetry (PDSC). The oil was storage for one-month in cool and dark place. Pomegranate seed oil has been shown to have a high content of conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA), which account for 42% of total fatty acids. Pomegranate seed oil was a source of MUFA and PUFA acids. The predominant MUFA acid in the oils tested was oleic acid. No statistically significant changes were observed in the fatty acid composition of pomegranate seed oils after one-month storage period. However, the oxidation induction time for the tested oil was relatively short, and its oxidative stability decreased significantly after storage.

The disease is inherited recessively and affects 1:5000 males. Loss of dystrophin leads to dysfunction of many types of cells due to the tissue-specific synthesis of different isoforms in healthy people. The longest Dp427 isoform is synthesized in the striated muscle and in smaller amounts in the brain while Dp260, Dp140, and Dp116 were found in the retina, the brain, and Schwann cells, respectively. The smallest isoforms Dp71/Dp40, show a ubiquitous expression pattern. The first symptoms of DMD appear around 2 years of age. Initially, patients have difficulties with climbing stairs and frequent falls. By the age of 12 years, patients are generally bound to a wheelchair and die between 20 and 40 years of age due to cardiac-respiratory failure. Moreover, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms are seen in a subset of DMD patients with the additional lack of Dp140 and Dp71 isoforms in the brain. Despite extensive pre-clinical and clinical studies, no effective therapy is currently available to DMD patients. We hypothesized that either the N-terminal part or the C-terminal part of dystrophin might determine therapeutic potential of dystrophin in distinct tissues. To address that, we created vectors encoding dystrophin isoforms Dp71 and Dp116 with and without the C-terminal part in two versions: one containing the EGFP and FLAG sequences and the other containing only the FLAG tag. Then, the prepared vectors were introduced into a simplified dystrophin-deficient HeLa cell model. These cells show a number of phenotypic changes, including an increased surface area of the cell nucleus with a simultaneous decrease in its circularity, decreased mitochondrial activity, increased permeability of the cell membrane and oxidative stress. Our data indicate that these vectors might have therapeutic potential, as they normalized VDAC level.","","","Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Dp71; Dp116; C-terminal domain","Tobiasz Kansik","Institute of Human Biology and Evolution, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University, ul.

In the canonical pathway, this system targets proteins for proteasome-dependent degradation by attaching ubiquitin molecules to specific lysine residues in these proteins. This study explores the concept of non-canonical, i.e. lysine-independent, proteasome-dependent ubiquitination in the context of lysine deserts – regions within proteins markedly deficient in lysine residues – and their potential to deter ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Our research focuses on the human FBXL15 (F-box and leucine rich repeat protein 15) which acts as a receptor in the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex. FBXL15, by directing SMURF1 (SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1) degradation, regulates BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling during embryonic development and adult bone formation. The main aim of the study was to elucidate the effect of lysine deserts on the ubiquitination and turnover of FBXL15, which was predicted to have an unstable C-terminus. Our results show that there is no significant difference in protein turnover between wild-type FBXL15 and its mutant lacking the sole two lysines, demonstrating the role of lysine desert in protecting this receptor from missense canonical ubiquitination from the hands of by E3 ligase complex. Our research also reveals that the degradation of the FBXL15 variant with a locked C-terminus is regulated in a cullin ligase-dependent manner, unlike the FBXL15 protein with a locked N-terminus. Our study advances our understanding of the functional role of lysine deserts in the context of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.It sheds new light on the regulatory mechanisms of the UPS that ensure precise and timely degradation of target proteins while avoiding accidental ubiquitination and degradation of the components of this system with implications for the regulation of key physiological processes such as BMP signaling and bone mass maintenance.","","","ubiquitin-proteasome system; lysine deserts; FBXL15; protein turnover and stability","Gabriela Piórkowska","Laboratory of Protein Metabolism, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Warsaw, Poland","Anna Soszyńska","Laboratory of Protein Metabolism, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Warsaw, Poland","Natalia A.

Therefore, conventional methods of obtaining fragrance compounds, such as chemical synthesis, are being abandoned in favor of biotechnological solutions. An example of such is 2-phenylethanol (2-PE), an aromatic compound with a rose scent. So far, it has been produced synthetically or by direct extraction from plants. Both these routes, however, have disadvantages, hence alternatives are being sought. One of them is the microbial production via the Ehrlich pathway. This method allows for elevated productivities, but unfortunately due to the limited resistance of yeast to 2-PE high concentrations, possible strain modifications are being analyzed to further increase the production yield.    Over the last two decades hybridisation has been a powerful tool used to construct superior yeast for brewing and winemaking, allowing for the acquisition of non-GMO strains. However, little is known about hybrids used for other purposes, such as targeted 2-PE production. To address this gap, we analysed a new double and triple interspecies yeast hybrids in terms of 2-PE biosynthesis. For this purpose, batch cultures in two different media at 30°C were performed. Our results indicate that hybrids exceeded the values obtained by the parental strains by up to 10 times. Additionally, the results also showed that the hybrids exhibited significantly greater resistance to the toxic product than the original strains. The conducted experiments have confirmed that hybridisation is a promising method for modifying yeast strains. As a result, both 2-PE titers and tolerance to its inhibitory effects can be increased. The findings obtained have the potential to contribute to the development of practical solutions in the future.

The aim of this study was to analyze bacteriophage infection in the dual-species biofilm system of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. 	The study was performed in systems that enabled the analysis of interactions between the tested factors: P. aeruginosa and S. aureus along with the phages that infect them in both biofilm and dispersion systems. To characterize the biofilm, staining methods using resazurin and crystal violet were used. An analysis of the impact of phage pressure on changes in population structure was also carried out using breeding methods on dedicated media. 	The analysis results indicate high activity in reducing bacterial biofilm produced by both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. It has been noticed that the use of a phage infecting P. aeruginosa leads to the emergence of phage insensitive mutants (BIM), which are characterized by a different biofilm structure. Moreover, in the tested two-species biofilm model, when it was not subjected to phage pressure, niche takeover by P. aeruginosa was observed.  	The analysis shows that the use of phage therapy consisting of one phage in a model with unknown etiology of the infection may result in the niche being taken over by another bacterium. The use of phage therapy in the form of ""phage cocktails"", which consists of mixtures of phages infecting both native and BIM forms, and detailed knowledge of the microbiological composition of the infection can significantly increase the effectiveness of the phage therapy used.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of bacteriophage therapy in a human blood model using Staphylococcus aureus and to examine the basic immune response within 6 hours of administration of bacteriophages. Blood collected from the arm vein was used for the study. To assess the effectiveness of the therapy the sample was incubated at 37℃.

HO exists as two isoenzymes: constitutive heme oxygenase (HMOX2) and inducible heme oxygenase (HMOX1), which decomposes heme to biliverdin (BV), carbon monoxide (CO) and iron. The resulting compounds will contribute to the induction of intracellular pathways, resulting in cytoprotective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Our team has shown that the lack of nuclear heme oxygenase affects cell cycle regulation, which leads to replication stress and increases DNA breaks. Many proteins, including PARP-1, play an important role in the response to DNA damage. PARP1 covers many cellular functions: proliferation, tumor transformation, differentiation and regeneration after DNA damage. The activity of PARP-1 is called parylation, which means polyADP-ribose (PAR) synthase by using NAD+ and transferring PAR moieties to proteins (ADP-ribosylation). Determining the co-colocalization of PARP-1 and HO-1 in the cell nucleus by performing the PLA assay, changes in the overall protein level and its activity in cells with/without HO-1, led our team to investigate the interaction between PARP-1 and heme oxygenase and its impact on PARP activity, which is the aim of this work.

Therefore, such phages can be used as a sensing element in a biosensor. Consequently, our aim is to find an effective support for the immobilization of the phage that could be implemented in electrochemical systems. In our studies, we used hydrogenated laterally spaced TiO2 nanotubes which were fabricated via anodization and calcination in hydrogen atmosphere. Due to the hydrogenation, titania nanotubes exhibit high electric conductivity that combined with substantial surface area make them excellent electrode material. We measured the response of the titania nanotube electrodes in various concentrations of adsorbed M13 phages using square wave and cyclic voltammetry in the presence of 1,1-ferrocenedimethanol as a redox probe. Moreover time-dependent measurements were performed to evaluate the stability of the electrode modified with phage. The obtained results demonstrated that the phages were successfully adsorbed on the electrode surface. That suggests the potential use of hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes as a conductive and adhesive layer for M13 phages in biosensors.

When viral DNA is released in the cytoplasm of an infected cell, the cytoplasmic protein cGAS binds with it and dimerizes, which allows for the stabilization of its active form and initiates the synthesis of cGAMP. These are signaling molecules involved in the activation of the innate immune response by binding to STING. Subsequently, the STING protein dimerizes, translocates near the nuclear envelope, and initiates the activation of downstream proteins in the signaling pathway, ultimately leading to the expression of genes encoding type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is widely known that many viruses have evolved unique ways to evade or impair the host's innate immune response. The ectromelia virus (ECTV) (which causes mousepox) belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus, which also includes cowpox and monkeypox viruses, capable of causing zoonotic infections. For this reason, it is important to conduct research to better understand the poxviral infection impact on host cells. In this experiment, we focus on examining how the Moscow strain of ECTV affects the STING protein distribution, level, and activation. We employed the immunofluorescence and western blot techniques using anti-STING polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies and secondary antibodies labeled with a fluorochrome (Rhodamine red-X or FITC) or enzyme (HRP). Moreover, cGAMP, a specific agonist for STING, was utilized as a positive control to facilitate the assessment of STING activation. Our studies indicate that STING formed some structures like aggregates during ECTV infection, but it did not correspond with the activation of this protein. It suggests the existence of a viral protein that causes excessive oligomerization of STING, impairing its activity and interrupting the signaling response, thereby inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","","","ectromelia virus, STING protein, proinflammatory cytokines, L929 cell line, cGAS-STING pathway","Pola Pruchniak","Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Faculty of Animal Breeding, Bioengineering and Conservation","PhD Karolina Gregorczyk-Zboroch","Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Department of Preclinical Sciences, Institute of Veterinary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","Pola Pruchniak","Pola Pruchniak","s203082@sggw.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

Polθ is a DNA polymerase involved in several DNA repair mechanisms, but mainly in theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) – one of the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathways. The DNA repair destabilization and genetic mutations are the cancer hallmarks, making it possible to use the synthetic lethality (SL) approach to selectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting one of the DNA repair proteins. Furthermore, cancer cells with alterations in HR or NHEJ pathways often become dependent on TMEJ. Previous studies of our group have already shown SL interaction between inhibition of other proteins involved in DNA repair mechanisms such as PARP1 and DNA ligase 4 or class I histone deacetylases in melanoma cells, but not yet the Polθ. The main objective of the research was to determine the influence of Polθ inhibition and its combination with PARP or Rad52 inhibition on melanoma cells. In order to evaluate it, we analyzed cell viability, cell apoptosis and histone H2AX phosphorylation with flow cytometry, DNA damage via comet assay and cell proliferation by clonogenic assay.  The results show that inhibition of Polθ alone gives a much lower anticancer effect than its combination with PARPi or Rad52i. What is more, the addition of an alkylating agent – dacarbazine (DTIC) enhances their activity. This combination causes a significant reduction in cell viability and proliferation, as demonstrated by decreased colony formation compared to the control or single treatment with inhibitors or DTIC. Additionally, the combination of inhibitors and inhibitors with DTIC causes DNA damage, visible in an increased percentage of DNA in comet tail, as well as increased histone H2AX phosphorylation.

However, those microfluidic workflows require complex technological solutions and adept knowledge, making them difficult to implement in standard laboratories.  The combination of the benefits of microfluidic droplet generation with multistep biochemical reactions using only basic laboratory equipment could resolve this limitation. One way to achieve this is to generate microcapsules stable in the water phase, composed of a semipermeable shell and a hydrogel core with a tailored retention ability. Thanks to the permeability of the shell, the capsules can be used as very small compartments for complex molecular biology workflows, allowing for selective exchange and retention of reagents and cell components. Individual cells can be entrapped in the capsules and subsequently subjected to multistep reactions, including buffer exchanges, using simple laboratory equipment instead of complicated microfluidic platforms. This allows for the high-throughput character of an assay on a single-cell level, making it suitable for use in standard molecular biology laboratories.   Our goal was to establish a droplet microfluidic system for the generation of bead-containing hydrogel microcapsules, adaptable for complex molecular biology workflows, especially for genomic and transcriptomic studies on mammalian cells.

This line can spontaneously differentiate into a monolayer that functionally and morphologically resembles enterocytes. We assessed potential cytotoxicity using viability assays (trypan blue and clonogenic assay) and examined NP genotoxicity using flow cytometry assays. Our preliminary results showed no change in cell cycle distribution, no significant increase in DSBs and minimal increase in apoptotic cells.

Recent research carried out at the Department of Biophysics and Cancer Biology at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow has shown promising results using chemotherapy with annamycin, which in most animals strongly inhibited the development of melanoma metastases and prolonged animal survival.  The main reason for choosing annamycin as the therapeutic agent studied is the fact that it is currently recognized as one of the most effective drugs in oncological therapy because its modified chemical structure allows it to effectively penetrate the inside of tumour cells, regardless of the presence of MDR (multidrug resistance) proteins on their surface, while minimizing the risk of cardiotoxic effects as in the case of other anthracyclines.

These cells were isolated from a biopsy of a liver metastasis in a patient with uveal melanoma. These cells were used to create a 3D and 2D in vitro model of human UM liver metastases, taking advantage of the fact that these cells can grow in a single culture with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are extremely important for the formation of the liver metastatic niche.

Additionally, we observed a downregulation of four proteins in brain tumor samples from patients with hypertension compared to those without hypertension: Myeloperoxidase, NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit, Plexins, and EH domain-containing protein 3, suggesting their potential involvement in hypertension-associated tumor development. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay between hypertension and brain tumorigenesis at the molecular level, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for further investigation. Understanding the proteomic differences between brain tumor patients, with and without hypertension, may pave the way for personalized approaches in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of brain tumors in hypertensive individuals.","","","Glioma; Proteomics; GBM; Hypertension; HTN","Katarzyna Wawrzak-Pienkowska","Bialystok Provincial Complex Hospital, Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Internal Diseases with the Center for Endoscopic Diagnostics and Treatment","Tomasz Pienkowski","Medical University of Bialystok, Clinical Research Centre, Laboratory of Metabolomics and Proteomics","Tomasz Kowalczyk","Medical University of Bialystok, Clinical Research Centre, Laboratory of Metabolomics and Proteomics","Dominik Cysewski","Medical University of Bialystok, Clinical Research Centre, Laboratory of Metabolomics and Proteomics","Adam Kretowski","Medical University of Bialystok, Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Internal Diseases AND, Clinical Research Centre, Laboratory of Metabolomics and Proteomics","TRUE","Michal Ciborowski","KWP - Bialystok Provincial Complex Hospital, Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Internal Diseases with the Center for Endoscopic Diagnostics and Treatment;

The predominant causes of visual impairments are irreversible changes in the retinal structure and mutations leading to photoreceptor death in the retina. Despite some promising research, there is still no effective way to restore visual function in suffering people. Attempts aimed at preventing the complete loss of photoreceptors or restoring vision in a case of complete photoreceptor degeneration. The viral gene therapy that delivers light-sensitive proteins, called opsins, to surviving retinal cells seems the most direct way of curing blindness. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a light-gated ion channel that absorbs blue light with maximum activation at 470 nm. ChR2 was established to be a tool for genetically targeted optical remote control (optogenetics) of neurons and neural circuits. It is, therefore, possible that ChR2 delivery using the rabies virus (RV) technique will restore visually evoked and selective responses in an animal model of retinal degeneration. This project aimed to investigate whether the G-deleted rabies virus that carries Channelrhodopsin-2 (ΔG-RV-ChR2-mCherry) can infect retinal cells and restore the visual responses in the degenerated retina. To do so, we delivered the virus to the eye by intravitreal injection and performed optogenetic stimulation and single neuron recordings in the primary visual cortex and the superior colliculus of RhoP23H mouse model of photoreceptor degeneration. Our results showed that opsin delivery via RV restored the response to the blue light stimulation in a degenerated retina. We believe that the RV vector will be an efficient carrier of therapeutic protein such as opsins delivered to a diseased retina.

Adaptation to different environments requires metabolic flexibility and frequent switching from respiration to fermentation, which involve mitochondrial activity. C. albicans is Crabtree negative, as opposed to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-known model organism. We expect changes of retrograde signalling in C. albicans in comparison to budding yeasts due to different metabolic adaptations.  In S. cerevisiae ScRtg3/Rtg1 is a dimeric complex activating the RTG pathway. When the pathway is inactive, the dimer is present in the cytoplasm. Upon its dephosphorylation and activation of the RTG signalling, the complex is translocated to the nucleus, where it triggers a transcriptional response. Despite the homology between ScRtg3 and CaRtg3 proteins, it is not yet known whether mechanism of activation of the latter is phosphorylation dependent.  The aim of this project was to establish the importance of the phosphorylation state of the main transcription factor responsible for the induction of effector genes.

When viral DNA is released in the cytoplasm of an infected cell, the cytoplasmic protein cGAS binds with it and dimerizes, which allows for the stabilization of its active form and initiates the synthesis of cGAMP. These are signaling molecules involved in the activation of the innate immune response by binding to STING. Subsequently, the STING protein dimerizes, translocates near the nuclear envelope, and initiates the activation of downstream proteins in the signaling pathway, ultimately leading to the expression of genes encoding type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is widely known that many viruses have evolved unique ways to evade or impair the host's innate immune response. The ectromelia virus (ECTV) (which causes mousepox) belongs to the orthopoxvirus genus, which also includes cowpox and monkeypox viruses, capable of causing zoonotic infections. For this reason, it is important to conduct research to better understand the poxviral infection impact on host cells. In this experiment, we focus on examining how the Moscow strain of ECTV affects the STING protein distribution, level, and activation. We employed the immunofluorescence and western blot techniques using anti-STING polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies and secondary antibodies labeled with a fluorochrome (Rhodamine red-X or FITC) or enzyme (HRP). Moreover, cGAMP, a specific agonist for STING, was utilized as a positive control to facilitate the assessment of STING activation. Our studies indicate that STING formed some structures like aggregates during ECTV infection, but it did not correspond with the activation of this protein. It suggests the existence of a viral protein that causes excessive oligomerization of STING, impairing its activity and interrupting the signaling response, thereby inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","","","ectromelia virus, STING protein, proinflammatory cytokines, L929 cell line, cGAS-STING pathway","Pola Pruchniak","Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Faculty of Animal Breeding, Bioengineering and Conservation","PhD Karolina Gregorczyk-Zboroch","Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Department of Preclinical Sciences, Institute of Veterinary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","Pola Pruchniak","Pola Pruchniak","s203082@sggw.edu.pl","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","","",""

However, in addition to the main function, human enolases perform many additional cell-type and development specific functions and can be linked to a wide spectrum of diseases. Some of the enolases, including human and Klebsiella pneumoniae enolase, can exist in a cell surface protein form. In this form, enolase can interact with plasminogen and activate it. In the case of K. Pneumoniae, activated plasminogen degrades the extracellular matrix, promoting bacterial infection. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a process in which proteins spontaneously condense, creating a separated phase. Such separation is made possible by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins . K. pneumoniae enolase (UniProt: A6TD53) LLPS propensity prediction PSPer, PScore and ParSe v2 were used. Experimental confirmation was preformed using optical microscopy observation in  different buffer solutions. Additionally, enolase localisation in mammalan cells was performed using fluorescence confocal microscopy. K. pneumoniae prediciton results were not consistent. The probability of K. pneumoniae to undergoing LLPS was supported by ParSe v2, indicating the regions prone to undergo phase separation, while PSPer and PScore excluded such possibility of phase separation. Preliminary results indicate that enolase tested in different buffer solutions did not produce LLPS droplest. In contrast, it seems that agregates can appear in specific conditions. Confocal microscopy observations of enolase expressed in mammalian cells shown, that enolase was spread evenly throughout the cytoplasm. We conclude that K. pneumoniae enolase does not undergo LLPS in tested buffer solutions. However, we presume that K.

Here we investigated the impairment of CF cell function induced by PM administration. In our study, two different cell lines were investigated. The control cell line was HBE (human bronchial epithelial cell line) with functional CFTR channel. Additionally, the model for CF, CFBE cell line (human cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cell line) with ΔF508 CFTR mutation was used. Particulate matter (PM) as standard reference material <4µm diameter were obtained from NIST. To assess the toxicity of PM, MTT cell viability assay was conducted, with the use of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Alongside, the cell viability assay using trypan blue staining was performed. To elucidate the potential mechanism for the toxic effects of PM, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was determined using fluorescent probe- DCFDA (2’,7’ –dichlorofluorescin diacetate). The results show that there is a significant difference in cell viability of HBE and CFBE cells, upon treatment with different concentrations of PM. It was also discovered that basal ROS level of untreated with PM cells was higher in CF cell line compared to control HBE cells. Additionally, PM induced higher ROS production in CF cells. In conclusion, we confirmed higher susceptibility of CF cells to PM induced toxicity on cellular level. The effect may be correlated with ROS overproduction.

Endothelial cells (ECs) that line the inner surface of blood and lymph vessels pay critical role in maintaining healthy phenotype of vasculature. They regulate vasodilatation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) by the production of nitric oxide (NO), platelet aggregation, angiogenesis and response to inflammation. Aging dysregulates function of endothelial cells which contributes to a higher risk of CVDs in the elderly. Data suggest that proteins Nrf2 and Keap1 can be involved in this process.  Nrf2 (NFE2L2 – nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) is a transcription factor that mediates protective response against oxidative stress. Its activity is regulated by a redox-sensitive repressor Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) which drives it towards the pathway of proteasomal degradation. But, as we recently proposed, Keap1 can act independently from Nrf2 and be involved in the formation of S-nitrosothiols via attachment of nitroso groups on cysteine residues, leading to changes in protein function. In the absence of Nrf2, Keap1 binds with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and transnitrosating protein GAPDH, forming S-nitrosation (SNO) complex, similar to the one found in bacteria. This leads to premature senescence of ECs due to impaired autophagy, to the loss of proteostasis and accumulation of protein aggregates, and further to the loss of function. Such dysfunctional phenotype is not observed in ECs overexpressing Nrf2.  With age Nrf2 level decreases, which suggests that the same development can be occurring in physiological aging. Using angiogenesis, migration and proliferation assays, as well as NO fluorescent probes and Proteostat Dye for aggregates staining we study the relation between protein agreggation and cell function in young and aged human-derived endothelial cells with the possible involvement of S-nitrosation mediated by Keap1/NOS/GAPDH complex.

The mutant Y302A cyt bc1 was less enzymatically active and produced more ROS compared to the wild type (WT) in the absence of inhibitors. This effect could be caused by a change in hydration or hydrogen bonding between Tyr302 and residues in the iron-sulphur protein (Fe-S) neck region, which consequently affects the positioning of the Fe-S head region.

Efforts to overcome this resistance have led to the exploration of novel therapeutic targets, among which the mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly (MIA) pathway emerges as a promising candidate. The MIA pathway, crucial for mitochondrial protein import and redox homeostasis, features Mia40 as a central player. Mia40 is responsible for oxidizing cysteine residues in substrate proteins, facilitating their import into the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
